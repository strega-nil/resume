\sectiontitle{about me}
\sectioncontent{
  I'm a local of Seattle, an urbanism, transit, and active transportation
  advocate. I love working on things of a mechanical nature, and have worked
  on my own bikes, as well as those of my family and friends, for years.
  I'm not a professional bike mechanic, but I have done everything from
  converting my old brompton to electric, to replacing brakes, to switching out
  chainrings.
