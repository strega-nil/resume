\sectiontitle{about me}
\sectioncontent{
  I have loved coffee ever since my first job, packing bags of coffee for
  retail sales at Zoka. After university, I started working at Microsoft to
  utilize the skills I had with programming, but I have missed working in
  coffee and as a barista ever since I left Starbucks. I bought an espresso
  machine with the money I saved from that job and have been making coffee for
  myself and all of my friends ever since, and I'm excited to be able to make
  coffee as a job again.
