\sectiontitle{about me}
\sectioncontent{
  I am a software engineer who has long been fascinated by developer tooling and programming languages.
  I had an early start in the Rust community, then switched over to C++ six years ago.
  I absolutely love developer tooling for its customer-facing nature,
  and for the impact I can make in a customer's every-day experience.

\sectiontitle{significant projects}
\sectioncontent{

\project{\href{https://includecpp.org}{\#include <C++>}}{2018 -}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Founding member of, and moderator for, the \#include <C++> community -- the largest chatroom for C++ developers.
  \item We have a long-standing commitment for inclusion and diversity in the C++ community.
  \item Additionally, as part of my time in vcpkg, we opened an official vcpkg channel in the \#include <C++> discord.
\end{itemize}
\spacevv

\project{\href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/manifests}{vcpkg Manifests}}{May - September 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I lead the charge on designing and implementing the manifests feature from its initial RFC to completion.
  \item Completely changed how users interact with vcpkg,
  while still supporting strict backwards compatibility with existing usecases
  \item The necessary first step towards bringing the C++ package management experience in line with other languages,
  with both package versioning and user-local installation fully depending on manifests.
\end{itemize}
\spacevv
    
\project{\href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/registries}{vcpkg Registries}}{September 2020 - March 2021}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Another major feature, necessary for enterprise customers, closed source libraries, and package versioning.
  \item Again, lead the charge on designing and implementing.
  \item Well-loved by the community:
  ``[about registries] Isn't that beautiful. With Conan I couldn't come up with a working setup for this,
  and with vcpkg it just works with a minimal effort.'' (from \href{https://decovar.dev/blog/2022/10/30/cpp-dependencies-with-vcpkg/}{this blog post})
